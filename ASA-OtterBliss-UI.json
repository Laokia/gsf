This is optional but may be necessary for access to future features, such as quests.</>\n<RichColor Color=\"0,1,0,1\">https://discord.gg/BksGdV5pJf</>\n\nWelcome to the Otter-ly amazing Laokia Cluster public servers!\n\nPlease check the server rules and the important information!\n\nWe utilize a cross-chat system to link global server chat across the cluster servers and our discord server. Stay connected, and always be able to contact an admin if you need help!\n\nYou can also join the server Discord or use the provided contact info to get in touch with the server owners or admins. If there is anything you need, or you are experiencing issues with the server, don't hesitate to contact us!\n\n\n<TextStyle.Red>Server Rules:</>\n\n- Keep things pleasant so the server remains a chill and low-stress place to hang out.\n\n- If PVP is enabled (for breeding or events, etc.) do not engage other players in PVP unless they agree to it.\n\n- No tolerance for harassment, flaming, bullying, trolling, griefing, or any similar behavior.\n\n- The owner has health issues that cause stress to be fairly dangerous, thus the importance of a low-stress server environment.\n\n- Asking for or needing help IS NOT stressful, you are not a bother, the server is for you!",

Otherwise, the engram for the teleporter pad is not available until level 88 to prevent overuse. There are public teleporters setup across the map, and a seperate teleporter for caves.\n\n\n<TextStyle.Orange>Pelayori's Cryo Storage Dino Backups:</>\n\nIf you store your dinos in a cryo capsule, they are automatically backed up to a file on the server. The server owners/admins can restore any dinos that are lost, so long as they have been backed up. As this is meant to be a chill, low-stress server, you may request for dinos that have been killed to be restored, not just those lost due to bugs/glitches.\n\n\n<TextStyle.Orange>Omega Storage Dino Saving:</>\n\nThe Omega Storage system can store dead dinos, so long as their body remains. The dino will be revived in storage. You can therefore save a lost dino if you can store its body!",

          "text2": "The Automated Ark storage system does not save the custom data of items. This means that any items with custom data will revert to a blank/empty state if pulled into the system. Custom recipes include custom data, as do Pelayori's cryo capsules.\n\nTo safely use the AA sorting system while using the cryopods, make sure to exclude all containers where you will store the capsules from the system. There are two methods to do this, and to be safe you should do both!\n\n1- Rename all Cryo Terminals and Cryofridges with AAxP in the name, as well as any other containers in which you will store items with custom data.\n\n1b- Use the AA helper remote to force the rename option to appear in the radial menu of containers that don't normally have it.\n\n2- In the AA Control Console menu, manually select the structures to be excluded from the system.",
